\format{
A data frame with 5,216,656 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
\item{IDA}{Character. Identifier for the first individual in the pair}
\item{IDB}{Character. Identifier for the second individual in the pair}
\item{KIN}{Numeric. Kinship coefficient between IDA and IDB, ranging from
0 (unrelated) to 1 (identical/self). A value of 0.5 indicates
parent-offspring or full siblings, 0.25 indicates half-siblings
or grandparent-grandchild, etc.}

\details{
A kinship matrix containing pairwise kinship coefficients between individuals
from the Human Connectome Project. The kinship coefficients quantify the
genetic relatedness between pairs of individuals.

This dataset contains kinship coefficients calculated from pedigree
information. The diagonal elements (IDA == IDB) have kinship = 1.0.
The matrix is symmetric, so kinship(IDA, IDB) == kinship(IDB, IDA).
