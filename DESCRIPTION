Description: SOLAR is the standard software program to perform linkage and
    association mappings of the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in pedigrees of
    arbitrary size and complexity. This package allows the user to exploit the
    variance component methods implemented in SOLAR. It automates such routine
    operations as formatting pedigree and phenotype data. It also parses the model
    output and contains summary and plotting functions for exploration of the
    results. In addition, solareclipser enables parallel computing of the linkage and
    association analyses, that makes the calculation of genome-wide scans more
    efficient. See <https://solar-eclipse-genetics.org//> for more information about
    SOLAR.
